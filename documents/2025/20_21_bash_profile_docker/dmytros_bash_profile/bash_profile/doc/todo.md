## Refactoring & Improvements

TODO: Create a workspace directory
    TODO: Keep a config file there
    TODO: Add a profile variables\define file
            - should contain the const variables from the scripts:
               e.g. URL's, folder path's, etc, so it can be easily fixed in one place for the whole profile
            - How to share this config between multiple platforms?
                - Keep a profile defines file inside profile folder?
                    - would hard to find variables
    TODO: Keep some session variables, so it can be shared between terminals. Like a shared memory
