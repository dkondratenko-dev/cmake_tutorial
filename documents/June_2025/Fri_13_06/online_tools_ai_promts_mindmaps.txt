How to use AI:

- context
- promt:

I want to learn how to work more effectively with various AI models.
Could you explain the general principles of how AI works for better understanding? Specifically,
 what is a 'context window' and how can I best utilize it? Also, please explain 'AI memory' and suggest
 the best ways to refresh the context so the AI doesn't lose track of the main conversation over time.

He will explain:
	- About the context window, how it works.
	- When AI starts to hallucinate and lose context. How to execute prompts effectively.

Q: How can I use AI so that it doesn't forget context and doesn't hallucinate?
Q: How can I learn to use AI more effectively? I want to become a professional in AI utilization.
During some task for AI:
Q: How can I best interact with you to accomplish this task?
Promt:
- You will be the lead developer or executor, and I will be your assistant.
You will tell me what to do, and I will execute the commands and provide you with the results.
- Please provide me with a plan or a list of steps to accomplish this task.

C++ AI roadmap:

I'm a C# developer aiming to transition to C++ for FinTech.
Please provide a study roadmap for C++ that includes relevant AI learning tools and models, presented in a Markdown document.
