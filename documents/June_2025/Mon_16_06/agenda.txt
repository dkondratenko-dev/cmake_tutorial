Dependency Injection:

- Note: Dependency Injection (DI) is a technique that helps achieve the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP), which is the "D" in SOLID.
Dependency Injection (DI): This is a design pattern and a technique for implementing the Dependency Inversion Principle. It's the mechanism by which you provide a class with its dependencies from an external source, rather than the class creating those dependencies

Common ways to perform Dependency Injection include:

Constructor Injection: Dependencies are passed into the class's constructor.
Setter Injection: Dependencies are set via public setter methods.
Interface Injection: The class implements an interface that defines the dependency.

- Dependecy injection, short repeat

- Show cmake examples from the real projects

- Memory leaks analysis
