Welcome! This document will walk you through understanding, identifying, and fixing memory leaks in C++ using AddressSanitizer (ASan). For someone coming from C# with its automatic garbage collection, explicit memory management in C++ is a significant shift. Fintech applications often demand high performance and low latency, making efficient and correct memory usage paramount.AddressSanitizer is a powerful runtime memory error detector. It can find:Use after freeUse after return (partial)Use after scope (partial)Double freeInvalid freeMemory leaksOut-of-bounds access (heap, stack, global)I. PrerequisitesTo follow along, you'll need a Linux environment (e.g., Ubuntu) with:g++ or clang++ (GCC 4.8+ or Clang 3.1+ is required for ASan support)CMake (version 3.0+)make or ninja (build system)VS Code with the CMake Tools extension (recommended for an integrated experience)You can install the compilers and CMake on Ubuntu/Debian with:sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential cmake
For VS Code, install the "C/C++ Extension Pack" which includes "CMake Tools".II. The C++ Code (main.cpp)This file contains two examples: a simple memory leak and a more complex one simulating trade data management.// main.cpp

Explanation of main.cpp:Trade struct: Represents a financial trade. Crucially, it includes a char* settlementInstructions to demonstrate dynamic allocation within an object and the need for a proper destructor (~Trade()) to free that memory. The setSettlementInstructions method also handles potential re-allocation leaks.TradeProcessor class:processAndAllocateTrade(): This is the problematic function. It dynamically allocates a Trade object using new and returns a raw pointer. If the caller doesn't explicitly delete this pointer, a memory leak occurs. This mimics scenarios where a factory function returns ownership, and the ownership is not managed.createSmartTrade(): This is the fixed/good practice function. It returns a std::unique_ptr<Trade>, ensuring that the allocated Trade object is automatically deallocated when the unique_ptr goes out of scope.simpleMemoryLeak(): A straightforward function that allocates an array of integers using new int[10] but never calls delete[].advancedMemoryLeak_problematic():Calls processAndAllocateTrade() in a loop, creating several Trade objects. Since the returned raw pointers are not stored or deleted, these become leaks.Demonstrates a re-assignment leak: A raw pointer is allocated, then the pointer is overwritten with a new allocation, losing the address of the first allocated block and making it unreachable (leaked).advancedMemoryLeak_fixed():Uses std::unique_ptr via createSmartTrade() and stores them in a std::vector<std::unique_ptr<Trade>>. When the vector or its elements go out of scope, memory is automatically freed.Shows how std::unique_ptr handles re-assignment correctly: The previously managed object is automatically deleted before the new object is assigned.main() function: Calls the problematic functions first, then the fixed one to demonstrate the difference in ASan output.III.

Explanation of CMakeLists.txt:cmake_minimum_required and project: Standard CMake boilerplate.set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17): Ensures C++17 features (like std::make_unique) are available.if(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE STREQUAL "Debug" ...): This crucial block enables ASan only for Debug or RelWithDebInfo builds. It's generally not enabled for Release builds due to performance overhead.-fsanitize=address: The main flag that tells g++ (or clang++) to enable AddressSanitizer. This is applied to both compilation and linking.-fno-omit-frame-pointer: Improves stack traces generated by ASan, making it easier to pinpoint the exact line of code causing an issue.-g: Includes debug information, which is essential for ASan to provide readable stack traces with file names and line numbers.add_executable(fintech_asan_example main.cpp): Defines your executable target.IV. Building the Project (Ubuntu + VS Code + CMake + g++)Follow these steps to build your project with AddressSanitizer enabled:Create Project Directory: Create a new folder (e.g., fintech_asan_project) and place both main.cpp and CMakeLists.txt inside it.Open in VS Code: Open the fintech_asan_project folder in VS Code.Configure CMake:VS Code's "CMake Tools" extension should automatically detect the CMakeLists.txt file.In the VS Code bottom status bar, you should see a "Build" button and a "Debug" button, along with a "No Kit Selected" or a detected compiler. Click on "No Kit Selected" and choose a C++ compiler (e.g., "GCC 11.x.x x86_64-linux-gnu" or similar).Click the "Build" button in the status bar, or press Ctrl+Shift+P (or Cmd+Shift+P on Mac) to open the Command Palette, type CMake: Configure and select it. This will create a build directory and generate build files.Select Build Type (Important for ASan):In the VS Code status bar, click on the current build type (e.g., "Debug", "Release").Select Debug or RelWithDebInfo. ASan is configured to activate for these build types in your CMakeLists.txt.Build the Project:Click the "Build" button in the VS Code status bar, or use the Command Palette: CMake: Build.Alternatively, open a terminal in VS Code (`Ctrl+``) and navigate to your project root. Then execute:mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug # or RelWithDebInfo
make
This will compile your code and produce the executable fintech_asan_example inside the build directory.V. Running with AddressSanitizer and Analyzing OutputOnce built, run the executable. ASan automatically intercepts memory operations and reports errors to stderr.Open Integrated Terminal: In VS Code, open a new terminal (`Ctrl+``).Navigate to Build Directory:cd build

SUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: 288 byte(s) leaked in 4 allocation(s).
Analysis for Advanced Leak:Notice multiple leak of 72 byte(s) reports. This corresponds to the Trade objects. A Trade object (which contains strings, doubles, longs, and a char*) will be larger than 4 bytes, so 72 bytes seems plausible for its size + overhead.For the first three leaks, the stack trace points to:#1 ... in TradeProcessor::processAndAllocateTrade(...) .../main.cpp:81
#2 ... in advancedMemoryLeak_problematic() .../main.cpp:106
This clearly shows that memory allocated by new Trade(...) on line 81 (inside processAndAllocateTrade) was leaked, and the call originated from line 106 (the loop in advancedMemoryLeak_problematic). This highlights that the caller of processAndAllocateTrade failed to deallocate the returned pointer.For the last leak, the stack trace points directly to:#1 ... in advancedMemoryLeak_problematic() .../main.cpp:115
This identifies the line where anotherLeakyTrade = new Trade("LEAK_002", ...); was called, indicating the previous Trade("LEAK_001", ...) (allocated on line 113) was leaked because its pointer was overwritten.SUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: 288 byte(s) leaked in 4 allocation(s).: This gives you the total summary. (3 * 72 bytes from the loop + 1 * 72 bytes from the re-assignment = 288 bytes).Important ASAN_OPTIONS environment variable:By default, ASan might only report memory leaks on program exit. You can control its behavior using the ASAN_OPTIONS environment variable. For example, to always detect leaks:export ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_leaks=1
./fintech_asan_example
Or, if you want detailed information, you can use:export ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_leaks=1:log_path=./asan.log:fast_unwind_on_malloc=0
./fintech_asan_example
This will write the ASan report to asan.log and ensure full stack traces.VI. Fixing the Leaks and Understanding Smart PointersThe main.cpp already contains the advancedMemoryLeak_fixed() function which demonstrates the correct way to handle dynamic memory. The key to fixing these leaks is using smart pointers from the C++ Standard Library, specifically std::unique_ptr.Fix for Simple Memory Leak:In simpleMemoryLeak(), the fix is straightforward: add a delete[] call.// main.cpp (Fixed simpleMemoryLeak function)

void simpleMemoryLeak() {
    std::cout << "\n--- Running Simple Memory Leak Example ---" << std::endl;
    int* data = new int[10]; // Allocate memory for 10 integers
    std::cout << "  Allocated 10 ints. Will free it now." << std::endl;
    data[0] = 100; // Use it

    delete[] data; // FIX: Free the allocated memory
    data = nullptr; // Good practice: nullify pointer after freeing
    std::cout << "  Freed 10 ints." << std::endl;
}
Fix for Advanced Memory Leak (already in main.cpp):The advancedMemoryLeak_fixed() function demonstrates the proper use of std::unique_ptr.Automatic Cleanup with std::unique_ptr:Instead of returning raw pointers from TradeProcessor::processAndAllocateTrade (which forces the caller to remember to call delete), the TradeProcessor::createSmartTrade function returns a std::unique_ptr<Trade>. std::unique_ptr is a smart pointer that owns the object it points to. When the unique_ptr itself goes out of scope, it automatically calls delete on the managed object. This adheres to the "Resource Acquisition Is Initialization" (RAII) principle, a cornerstone of robust C++ code.std::vector<std::unique_ptr<Trade>> trades;: Storing unique_ptrs in a container like std::vector means that when the vector is cleared or goes out of scope, each unique_ptr within it will be correctly destroyed, and in turn, the Trade object it manages will be deleted.Handling Re-assignment Safely:When you re-assign a std::unique_ptr (e.g., goodTrade = std::make_unique<Trade>(...)), the object previously managed by goodTrade is automatically deleted before the new object is assigned. This prevents the "overwritten pointer" type of leak seen in the problematic example.The Trade Destructor (~Trade()):Even with smart pointers managing the Trade object itself, it's crucial that the Trade struct has its own destructor (~Trade()) to clean up any memory it dynamically allocates internally (like settlementInstructions). If settlementInstructions wasn't freed in ~Trade(), then even if Trade objects were properly deleted by smart pointers, the char* inside them would still leak!After applying the fix to simpleMemoryLeak() and running the fixed version in main, you should see no ASan memory leak reports at the end of the execution (only the program's console output).VII. VS Code Tips for C++ DevelopmentCMake Tools Extension: As mentioned, this extension is invaluable. It helps you configure, build, and debug your CMake projects directly from the VS Code UI.C/C++ Extension: Provides IntelliSense, code navigation, debugging, and other language features.Debugging with ASan: You can often configure VS Code debuggers (like GDB or LLDB) to work with ASan. When you launch a program compiled with ASan under a debugger, ASan's reports will typically appear in the debugger console, allowing you to set breakpoints and inspect the state when a memory error occurs.Tasks: You can define custom build/run tasks in .vscode/tasks.json to easily execute cmake --build or run your executable with ASAN_OPTIONS set.settings.json: You can configure CMake-related settings (e.g., default build type) in your workspace .vscode/settings.json.This example should provide a solid foundation for your mentee to understand explicit memory management, common leak scenarios in a fintech context, and how to leverage AddressSanitizer for effective debugging on Linux with VS Code and CMake. Good luck!
