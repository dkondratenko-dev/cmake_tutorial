For remote_debugging.md Part 3: Docker Container Debugging - Complete Step-by-Step Guide, the three methods gave much trouble.

Method 1: Using Dev Containers (The Automatic Way)
Method 2: Manual Docker with GDB Server
Method 3: Docker with SSH (Most Flexible)

Workaround => run the container in interactive mode and debug via gdb from the terminal. (Not from vscode)
