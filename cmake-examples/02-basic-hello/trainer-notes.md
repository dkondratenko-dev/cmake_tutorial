# Trainer Notes ‚Äî 01: Basic Hello

## cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)

cmake_minimum_required(VERSION x.y)
This command ensures that the CMake version being used supports all the commands and features in your CMakeLists.txt.

It's important when your project runs on another machine ‚Äî if the user's CMake version is older than required, CMake will show an error immediately, letting the user know they need to update it.

```cmake
  cmake_minimum_required(VERSION <major>[.<minor>[.<patch>]] [FATAL_ERROR])
```

We use version 3.10 because it is common and stable.

Some features need newer versions, we will see them later.

```cmake
project(BasicHello VERSION 1.0 LANGUAGES CXX)
```

üí° Note: You can omit LANGUAGES and CMake will default to **C and CXX**.

Declares a CMake project.

BasicHello is the project name.

VERSION 1.0 is optional, but a good habit.

LANGUAGES CXX tells CMake this is a C++ project.
Other supported options: C, CXX, CUDA, Fortran, ASM, OBJC, OBJCXX, HIP, ISPC, Swift
The full list can be found here: <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/project.html>

Syntax:

```cmake
project(<name> [VERSION <major>[.<minor>[.<patch>]]] [LANGUAGES <lang>...])
add_executable(hello src/main.cpp)
```

Adds a target that will be compiled to an executable.
'hello' is the name of the executable.

src/main.cpp is the source file.

Syntax:

```cmake
add_executable(<name> [WIN32|MACOSX_BUNDLE] [EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL] source1 [source2 ...])
```

## Generators list

cmake  - - help ‚Äì will print generators available in the system
cmake -G ‚ÄúVisual Studio 16 2019‚Äù ..

## üîß Build Instructions

### 1. Create a separate build folder

This keeps the main project folder clean. All build files and system-specific scripts will go here.  
It‚Äôs common to add this folder to `.gitignore`.

```bash
mkdir build
```

### 2. Enter the build directory

```bash
cd build
```

### 3. Generate build files using CMake

This step reads the `CMakeLists.txt` from the parent folder:

```bash
cmake ..
```

### 4. Build the project

Use the following command to build the target (e.g., `helloWorld`) in **Release** mode:

```bash
cmake --build . --config Release --target helloWorld
```

---

‚úÖ **Tip**:  

- On **Linux**, `--config Release` is usually optional.  
- On **Windows** (e.g., with Visual Studio), `--config` is often required.

## Notes

It‚Äôs a good practice to keep source files inside a src/ directory.

Later examples will include:

include/ folder for headers

linking external libraries

compile options via target_compile_features and more
